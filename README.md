##What I learned
In this project, I learned how to make a website that works well on computers, tablets, and phones using Bootstrap. I practiced using Bootstrap components like navbars, buttons, cards, and carousels, and learned to style them with CSS. I improved my HTML and CSS skills, and learned how to make a website easy to use with clear layouts and interactive features. I also learned how to plan a project, fix problems, and deploy a live website.
